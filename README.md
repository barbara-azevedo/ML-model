# Machine learning - pycaret


**PYCARET** is a Python library for data science and machine learning. It can be used for easier ML model implementation.


In this project there are two applications for this library. For both cases, it's consider that the data in the database is already cleaned - no empty values, no duplicated columns/lines, removed useless information and others. For both applications it's necessary to have the target result in the dataset - for these examples the target is represented by column "Result". 

- modelo12_pycaret.py: application of pycaret library in data set to evaluate best model option, example: grandient boosting, random forest and others. In this application it's possible to evaluate the results by model perfomance and confusion matrix. 

- modelo12_pycaret - neural.py: application of pycaret library in data set to evaluate best neural network performance. 



In this repository there is also an Orange example for evaluating and comparing ML models.
